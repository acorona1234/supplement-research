# Evidence-Based Supplements for ASD & ADHD

*A Parent's Guide to Research-Supported Nutritional Interventions*

---

## Executive Summary

Several nutritional supplements have demonstrated meaningful benefits for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and/or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in randomized controlled trials. While none replace conventional treatment, omega-3 fatty acids, targeted minerals (zinc, iron), and specific vitamins can serve as valuable adjuncts—particularly when underlying deficiencies are identified. This document summarizes the current evidence to help families make informed decisions alongside their healthcare providers.

## Before You Start: What to Test

Before beginning any supplement regimen, consider testing for deficiencies that are common in ASD/ADHD populations and may guide treatment:

| Test | Why It Matters | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Serum Ferritin (Iron)** | Children with ADHD frequently have lower iron stores | Supplement *only* if deficient—excess iron is harmful |
| **Serum Zinc** | Zinc deficiency linked to ADHD severity | Low levels predict better response to zinc supplementation |
| **25-OH Vitamin D** | Often low in ASD; affects behavior | Dosing should be based on blood levels |
| **Folate Receptor Autoantibodies (FRAAs)** | Present in subset of ASD children | Predicts response to folinic acid therapy |

> 💡 **Tip:** Bring this list to your child's pediatrician and request baseline testing before starting supplements.

## Supplements by Evidence Tier

### Tier 1: Strong Evidence

#### For ADHD

| Supplement | Benefit | Dosage | Key Finding |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Omega-3 Fatty Acids** | Reduces hyperactivity & inattention | 1–2g EPA+DHA daily | Most consistent evidence; higher EPA ratios more effective |
| **Zinc** | Adjunct to stimulants | 15–30mg daily | Reduced stimulant dose needed by 37% in trials |
| **Iron** | Supports dopamine function | Per deficiency | Only supplement when ferritin is low |

### Tier 2: Moderate Evidence

#### For ADHD

| Supplement | Benefit | Dosage | Key Finding |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Broad-Spectrum Micronutrients** | Emotional regulation, aggression | Per product label | Most effective for emotional dysregulation |
| **Phosphatidylserine (PS)** | Improves attention | 200–300mg daily | Often combined with omega-3s for synergy |
| **Saffron Extract** | ADHD symptoms overall | 20–30mg daily | Performed equivalently to methylphenidate in 6-week RCT |

#### For ASD

| Supplement | Benefit | Dosage | Key Finding |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Probiotics (Multi-Strain)** | Behavioral symptoms, adaptability | Per product label | Does *not* improve core ASD symptoms |
| **Omega-3 Fatty Acids** | Hyperactivity, speech (ages ≤8) | 1–2g EPA+DHA daily | Requires >14 weeks for effect |
| **Folinic Acid** | Language & communication | 0.5–2mg/kg daily | Best response in children with FRAAs |
| **Vitamin D** | Stereotypical behaviors | Based on blood levels | Dose individualized to achieve sufficiency |
| **N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)** | Irritability | 900–2700mg daily | Antioxidant with glutamate-modulating effects |

### Herbal: Promising

| Supplement | Condition | Dosage | Evidence |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Saffron** | ADHD | 20–30mg daily | Single RCT showed equivalence to methylphenidate; most promising herbal option |

## Safety Notes & Interactions

### General Principles
- **More is not better.** Stick to studied doses.
- **Test before supplementing** iron and zinc—toxicity is possible.
- **Allow adequate time.** Most supplements need 8–14+ weeks to show effects.
- **Inform all providers.** Keep your child's doctor aware of all supplements.

### Specific Cautions

| Supplement | Safety Consideration |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Iron** | Never supplement without confirmed deficiency; can be toxic |
| **Zinc** | High doses can deplete copper; use balanced formulations |
| **NAC** | May interact with nitroglycerin; generally well-tolerated |
| **Saffron** | Limited long-term safety data; avoid in pregnancy |
| **Omega-3s** | High doses may increase bleeding risk; pause before surgery |
| **Folinic Acid** | Different from folic acid—ensure correct form |

### Drug Interactions
- **Zinc + Stimulants:** May allow lower stimulant dosing (coordinate with prescriber)
- **Omega-3s + Blood Thinners:** Monitor for increased bleeding
- **NAC + Activated Charcoal:** NAC may be inactivated

## Key Takeaways

1. **Omega-3s are first-line** for both conditions—well-studied, safe, and affordable.

2. **Test for deficiencies** in iron, zinc, vitamin D, and folate receptor antibodies before supplementing.

3. **Zinc as a stimulant adjunct** can reduce medication needs by over a third in deficient children.

4. **Probiotics help behavior but not core ASD symptoms**—manage expectations accordingly.

5. **Saffron shows promise for ADHD** but needs more research before routine recommendation.

6. **Always involve your healthcare provider**—supplements can interact with medications and should be part of a comprehensive treatment plan.
