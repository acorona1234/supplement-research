# Supplements and Natural Remedies for OCD: Research Report

**Scout 🔍 Research Report | February 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

This report reviews peer-reviewed evidence on supplements and natural remedies studied for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The evidence is **mixed overall**, with most supplements showing preliminary or inconclusive results. The most studied supplement (N-acetylcysteine) has conflicting trial results, while some newer agents (saffron/crocin, 5-HTP, L-carnosine) show preliminary promise warranting further investigation.

**⚠️ Important Disclaimer**: This is a research summary, not medical advice. OCD is a serious condition requiring professional treatment. Always consult a psychiatrist before adding supplements, especially if taking SSRIs or other medications.

## TIER 1: MOST EVIDENCE (Multiple RCTs Available)

### 1. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)

**What it is:** Amino acid-based nutraceutical; glutamate modulator and antioxidant precursor to glutathione

**Mechanism:** Modulates synaptic release of glutamate via cysteine-glutamate antiporter; addresses glutamatergic dysfunction implicated in OCD pathophysiology

**Evidence Level:** 🟡 **MIXED/INCONCLUSIVE** - Multiple RCTs with conflicting results

#### Key Studies:

| Study | Year | Design | N | Dose | Duration | Outcome |
|-------|------|--------|---|------|----------|---------|
| **Paydary et al.** | 2016 | RCT, double-blind, adjunct to fluvoxamine | 44 | 2000 mg/day | 10 weeks | ✅ **POSITIVE**: Significant Y-BOCS reduction (p=0.012) |
| **Sarris et al.** | 2015 | RCT, double-blind, placebo-controlled | 44 | 3000 mg/day | 16 weeks | 🟡 **MIXED**: No overall effect, but significant reduction in compulsions subscale (p=0.013) |
| **Costa et al.** | 2017 | RCT, treatment-resistant OCD | 40 | 3000 mg/day | 16 weeks | ❌ **NEGATIVE**: No significant benefit vs placebo; may help anxiety (p=0.02) |
| **Sarris et al.** | 2022 | Phase III RCT, multi-site | 98 | 2-4g/day | 20 weeks | ❌ **NEGATIVE**: No evidence of efficacy |

**2022 Meta-Analysis (Kishi et al.):** Analyzed 10 NAC studies for OCD-related disorders. Found NAC **outperformed placebo in overall symptom improvement (p<0.01)**, but results were modest.

**2018 Systematic Review (Couto & Moreira):** Pooled analysis of 4 RCTs showed mean difference of 3.35 (p=0.07), "trending toward favoring NAC but not statistically significant."

**Typical Dosages in Studies:** 2000-3000 mg/day (often split into 2 doses)

**Study Context:** All studies used NAC as **adjunct to SSRIs/SRIs** (not monotherapy)

**Safety Profile:**
- Generally well-tolerated
- Most common adverse events: gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, heartburn, abdominal pain)
- One study: abdominal pain significantly more common in NAC group (60% vs 13.3%)

## CONCLUSIONS

1. **No supplement has strong evidence** supporting standalone use for OCD

2. **N-Acetylcysteine** is the most studied but results are mixed; may have modest benefit as add-on therapy, particularly for compulsions; well-tolerated

3. **Saffron/Crocin** shows intriguing preliminary evidence as potentially comparable to SSRIs for mild-moderate OCD, but only 2 trials exist

4. **5-HTP** showed strong results in one trial but carries serious serotonin syndrome risk with SSRIs

5. **L-Carnosine** is promising based on one positive RCT; good safety profile

6. **Inositol** had one early positive study but meta-analysis shows no significant effect

7. **St. John's Wort and Omega-3s** are NOT effective based on current evidence

8. **Vitamin D, probiotics, curcumin, ashwagandha** lack any OCD-specific treatment trials

9. **First-line treatment remains SSRIs + CBT (ERP)** - supplements should only be considered as adjuncts or for treatment-resistant cases under medical supervision
