# 🧬 Synergistic Supplement Protocol for ASD/ADHD/OCD

*A practical at-home guide combining evidence-based supplements strategically*

**⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** This protocol is for educational purposes only. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen, especially for children. Individual needs vary significantly.

---

## 📋 Pre-Protocol Testing (Recommended)

Before starting, consider these baseline tests:

| Test | Why It Matters | Target Range |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Serum Ferritin** | Iron stores; low ferritin linked to ADHD | 50-100 ng/mL (optimal) |
| **RBC Zinc** | More accurate than serum zinc | 12-14 mg/L |
| **25-OH Vitamin D** | Many with ASD/ADHD are deficient | 40-60 ng/mL |
| **Folate Receptor Autoantibodies (FRAAs)** | If considering folinic acid for ASD | Negative ideal |
| **Complete Metabolic Panel** | Baseline organ function | Within normal limits |
| **Homocysteine** | Methylation status | <10 μmol/L |

---

## 🔬 The Science of Synergy

### Why Combinations Work Better

**1. PS + Omega-3s = Enhanced Membrane Function**
- Phosphatidylserine (PS) forms the membrane structure
- Omega-3s (DHA/EPA) integrate into membranes, improving fluidity
- Together: Better neuronal signaling, improved attention
- *Studies show PS-DHA conjugates have superior bioavailability*

**2. Zinc + B6 (P5P) = Neurotransmitter Support**
- Both are cofactors for dopamine and serotonin synthesis
- Zinc activates B6 to its active form (P5P)
- Together: Enhanced neurotransmitter production
- *Classic combination in functional medicine for ADHD*

**3. NAC + Glycine = Glutathione Boost**
- NAC provides cysteine (rate-limiting precursor)
- Glycine is another glutathione building block
- Together: Up to 200% increase in glutathione synthesis
- *Addresses oxidative stress common in ASD/OCD*

**4. Vitamin D + Omega-3s = Enhanced Absorption**
- Vitamin D is fat-soluble
- Omega-3s provide optimal fat matrix
- Together: Better vitamin D uptake and utilization

**5. Iron + Vitamin C = 3x Better Absorption**
- Vitamin C converts iron to more absorbable form
- Also protects against GI side effects
- *Critical for addressing ADHD-related iron deficiency*

**6. Probiotics + Prebiotic Fiber = Colonization Success**
- Prebiotics feed beneficial bacteria
- Improves probiotic survival and function
- Together: Better gut-brain axis support

## 🏗️ The Three-Tier Protocol

### TIER 1: FOUNDATION (For Everyone)
*Start here. Build this base over 2-4 weeks before adding condition-specific supplements.*

#### Morning Stack (WITH BREAKFAST containing fats)

| Supplement | Dose | Form | Why |
|------------|------|------|-----|
| **Omega-3s (EPA+DHA)** | 1-2g combined | Triglyceride form, flavored liquid for kids | Membrane health, reduces hyperactivity |
| **Vitamin D3** | 1000-2000 IU (kids), 2000-4000 IU (adults) | With K2 (MK-7) | Most are deficient; helps stereotypy |
| **Magnesium** | 100-200mg (kids), 200-400mg (adults) | Glycinate or Threonate | Calming, cofactor for 300+ enzymes |

#### Evening Stack (WITH DINNER)

| Supplement | Dose | Form | Why |
|------------|------|------|-----|
| **Probiotics** | 10-25 billion CFU | Multi-strain (Lactobacillus + Bifidobacterium) | Gut-brain axis support |
| **Prebiotic Fiber** | 2-5g | Inulin, GOS, or partially hydrolyzed guar gum | Feeds probiotics |

**Foundation Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Start omega-3s and vitamin D only
- Week 3-4: Add magnesium and probiotics
- Assess tolerance before moving to Tier 2

---

### TIER 2: CONDITION-SPECIFIC ADDITIONS

#### 🧩 For ASD Features (Add to Foundation)

| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Target Symptom |
|------------|------|--------|----------------|
| **NAC** | Start 300mg, increase to 900-1800mg | Divided: AM & PM with food | Irritability, repetitive behaviors |
| **Folinic Acid*** | 0.4-2mg/kg/day | Morning, empty stomach | Language (if FRAA positive) |
| **Methylated B-Complex** | Age-appropriate | Morning | Methylation support |

*\*Only if FRAA testing is positive or strongly suspected*

**ASD Protocol Notes:**
- NAC has a sulfur smell - can be hidden in smoothies
- Start NAC low (300mg) and increase slowly over 2-3 weeks
- Folinic acid is NOT the same as folic acid

---

#### 🎯 For ADHD Features (Add to Foundation)

| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Target Symptom |
|------------|------|--------|----------------|
| **Phosphatidylserine (PS)** | 100-200mg (kids), 200-300mg (adults) | Morning with omega-3s | Attention, memory |
| **Zinc** | 15mg (kids), 15-30mg (adults) | Morning with breakfast | Enhances stimulant meds, attention |
| **Saffron Extract** | 20-30mg (standardized to 3.5% crocin) | Morning | Focus, mood (comparable to methylphenidate) |
| **Iron*** | 18-30mg | Evening (4h after zinc), with vitamin C | If ferritin <50 |

*\*Only if testing confirms deficiency*

**ADHD Protocol Notes:**
- PS + Omega-3s taken together = synergistic membrane support
- Zinc enhances the effect of stimulant medications
- Saffron can be used instead of OR with stimulants (discuss with doctor)

---

#### 🔄 For OCD Features (Add to Foundation)

| Supplement | Dose | Timing | Target Symptom |
|------------|------|--------|----------------|
| **NAC** | 1200-2700mg/day | Divided: 600-900mg 2-3x daily | Compulsions, intrusive thoughts |
| **Saffron Extract** | 20-30mg | Morning | Mood, anxiety (SSRI-like effects) |
| **Glycine** | 3-5g | Evening | Enhances NAC, calming |
| **L-Carnosine*** | 400-800mg | Morning with food | Adjunct if on SSRIs |

*\*If already taking SSRIs*

**OCD Protocol Notes:**
- NAC works through glutamate modulation - different mechanism than SSRIs
- Saffron + SSRIs: use caution, discuss with prescriber (serotonin interaction)
- Glycine is calming and sweet-tasting - easy to add to drinks

---

### TIER 3: ADVANCED COMBINATIONS

*Only after 2-3 months on Tier 1 + 2 with good tolerance*

#### The "Brain Builder" Stack
For maximum cognitive support:
```
Morning (with fatty breakfast):
├── Omega-3s (1-2g EPA+DHA)
├── PS (200mg)
├── Vitamin D3/K2 (2000 IU)
└── Lion's Mane (500-1000mg) *optional nootropic*

This combination maximizes:
→ Membrane fluidity (omega-3s)
→ Membrane structure (PS)  
→ Neuroplasticity (D3, Lion's Mane)
```

#### The "Calm & Focus" Stack
For irritability + inattention:
```
Morning:
├── Saffron (20-30mg)
├── Zinc + B6 (15mg + 25mg P5P)
└── Omega-3s (1g)

Evening:
├── NAC (600-900mg)
├── Magnesium glycinate (200-300mg)
└── Glycine (3g)

This combination addresses:
→ Dopamine/serotonin (zinc, B6, saffron)
→ Glutathione/oxidative stress (NAC, glycine)
→ GABA/calm (magnesium, glycine)
```

#### The "Gut-Brain Reset" Stack
For GI issues + behavioral symptoms:
```
Before breakfast (empty stomach):
├── Probiotics (25 billion CFU multi-strain)
└── L-Glutamine (2-5g) *gut lining support*

With breakfast:
├── Omega-3s (1-2g)
├── Digestive enzymes (if needed)
└── Prebiotic fiber (3-5g)

Evening:
└── Magnesium citrate (200mg) *gentle motility support*
```
