## Executive Summary

Current scientific evidence for herbal treatments in ADHD and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) ranges from **promising to preliminary**. While several herbs show potential, **no herbal treatment has sufficient evidence to replace conventional ADHD medications**. Most studies have methodological limitations including small sample sizes, short duration, and variable standardization of extracts.

## SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS & DRUG INTERACTIONS

### General Warnings:

1. **Quality control:** Herbal products vary significantly in potency and purity
2. **Not FDA-regulated as drugs:** May contain contaminants or undeclared ingredients
3. **Pediatric dosing:** Often extrapolated from adult data; limited pharmacokinetic studies in children

### Specific Interactions with ADHD Medications:

| Herb | Interaction Risk | Mechanism |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| **St. John's Wort** | ⚠️ HIGH | CYP3A4 induction reduces stimulant levels; serotonin syndrome risk |
| **Ginseng** | MODERATE | May affect blood sugar; additive stimulant effects |
| **Valerian** | LOW-MODERATE | May enhance sedation; timing issues with stimulants |
| **Ginkgo** | MODERATE | Anticoagulant effects; P-glycoprotein interactions |
| **CBD** | MODERATE | CYP450 inhibition; may increase levels of some medications |
| **Saffron** | LOW | Possible serotonergic effects |
| **Bacopa** | LOW | May enhance sedatives; theoretical cholinergic effects |

---

## CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS (Based on Current Evidence)

### For ADHD:
1. **Most promising:** Saffron (equivalent to MPH in one RCT - needs replication)
2. **For cognitive support (adjunct):** Bacopa monnieri
3. **May help with hyperactivity component:** Korean Red Ginseng
4. **Not recommended as monotherapy:** Any herbal treatment

### For ASD:
1. **Emerging evidence:** CBD-rich cannabis extracts (for social symptoms, anxiety)
2. **Insufficient evidence:** All other herbal approaches

### General Guidance:
- **Always consult healthcare provider** before starting any herbal supplement
- **Do not discontinue** prescribed ADHD medications without medical supervision
- **Avoid St. John's Wort** if taking ADHD medications
- **Use standardized extracts** when possible
- **Start low, go slow** with dosing

---

## FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS

1. Larger, multi-center RCTs with longer follow-up
2. Head-to-head trials against active comparators (not just placebo)
3. Standardization of herbal preparations
4. Pharmacokinetic studies in pediatric populations
5. Long-term safety data
6. Combination studies (herbal + conventional treatment)
